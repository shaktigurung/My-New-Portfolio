6.	Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions,

    a.	Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

    In 1980, IBM hires Paul Allen and Bill Gates to create an operation system for a new PC. They buy the rights to simple operation system manufactured by Seattle Computer Products and use it as a template to develop DOS. Following year, MS-DOS Computer Operating System increases it success. SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) was introduced in 1982 and in year 1983, Domain Name System( DNS) was  pioneered by Jon Postel, Paul Mockapetris and Craig Partridge. Seven ‘top-level’ domain name was initially introduced (edu, gov, mil, net,org and int). Same year Microsoft Windows introduced the mouse to navigate through menus, tabs and icons. In 1984, Wiliam Gibson coins the word cyberspace when he publishes Neuromancer. By 1988, there were more that 45 million PCs used in United States. In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau propose a ‘hypertext’ system starting the modern Internet called “World Wide Web”. It was aimed to be launched to public on 6th August, 1991. At the beginning of the year 1993 only 50 World Wide Web servers are known to exist. Finally, in 1994 The World Wide Web Consortium was founded by Tim Berners-Lee and same year YAHOO was created too. In 1995 Amazon.com, EBay and Hotmail was founded. Year 1996 WebTV was introduced. In Year 1998 Google and Paypal was founded. The online social media Facebook was launched in 2004. The video sharing website YouTube was created in 2005 and bought by Google in 2006. Since then there has been massive changes in the world of Internet. We cannot imagine today’s world without Internet from shopping to billings everywhere Internet is taking over.


    b.	Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and Web Browsers.

    Domain name is a key part of the online address. It is what the visitors used to find the website. For example Facebook’s domain name is www.facebook.com. It is unique to every website and cannot be same once it’s registered. 

    Everything on the Internet is located at a unique address, which can be identified, by a name or a number. It is hard for human brain to remember every IP (Internet Protocol) address so we use Domain Name System to assign a unique domain name to these numbers. 
    Web browser is an application program that displays a web document. It usually used the Internet services to access the document. Each individual web page, image and video is identified by a distinct URL(Uniform Resource Locator), enabling browsers to retrieve and display them on the user’s device.

    Web server is a server software or hardware dedicated to running software that can serve contents to the World Wide Web. A web server helps to process web browser request and sends them the dedicated website. For example, if we type www.google.com then web server will look for the IP address of the google.com with the help of DNS and sends back the page associated with it to the web browser.


    c.	Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

    Internet Technology is a group of technologies that allow users to access information and communicate over the World Wide Web. It has revolutionized the world today. 
    Information sharing is one of the key aspects of the Internet technology that has contributed enormously to our current world. Whether it’s sharing information by individual in Facebook, YouTube or sharing information by an organization in a form of weather report, news etc., everyone use internet these days. Software firms use IP addresses of the available network nodes or available disk space to work in a collaborative way with team across the world.  

    Today, in our daily activities we explore Internet for various purposes such as paying bills, booking travel, banking and so on. We are so obsess with the Internet these days that we are crumbled if we do not have access to it for a while. It shows us how much we are dependent on the Internet and we cannot deny this fact. Hence, this aspect of the Internet Development has contributed a lot to Today’s World.
